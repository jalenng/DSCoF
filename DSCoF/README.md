## Context
This repository contains all the source code and assets for our SCEhacks 2021 "Code for California" hackathon project.

## Inspiration
We wanted to create something that anyone could understand, and we wanted to make it interactive. Our goal was to encourage social and behavioral changes by educating and bring awareness to issues. Ultimately, we decided on making a game, as we saw it as a fun and unique way to realize our goals.

## What it does
Our project is a game that quizzes and educates players on wildfire trivia.

## How we built it
We used Microsoft Whiteboard, Unity, Azure SQL, Flask, and art software to design and implement our project.

* Microsoft Whiteboard helped us ideate, collaborate, and design our project.
* Unity served as the game engine powering our game, and we used C# to code our game scripts.
* Azure SQL stores statistics about player choices, which the game retrieves and presents to the player at the end of the game. 
* Flask served as the backend server that interfaces with Azure SQL and provides an API endpoint for our Unity game.
* Aseprite and Adobe Photoshop were used to create game sprites.

## Challenges we ran into
- Getting Unity to communicate with our Flask server
- Using Azure SQL for the 1st time and having to learn

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Given that this hackathon was our first, we are proud to have participated. Furthermore, we are proud of the playable and testable prototype we have achieved in our two days of work.

## What we learned
- Communication and teamwork
- Ideation and rapid prototyping techniques
- Using Azure's cloud computing offerings

## What's next for "Don't Set California on Fire!"
We can expand our game to feature other topics relevant to California. We can also implement various question and answer types--ranking, matching, and text input, to name a few. 

Additionally, we can build our game for other platforms like iOS and Android to reach more people.

Also, we can increase the art quality to enhance the player experience.
